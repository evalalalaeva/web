                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The Beagle breed has origins that can be traced back to Roman times, but the Beagle as we
                            know it today was developed in the 19th century in England. Beagles were bred for the
                            purpose of hunting small game, particularly rabbits, due to their excellent sense of smell.
                            This breed's sense of smell is only surpassed by the Bloodhound. They were also prized for
                            their compact size, allowing a pack of Beagles to be transported easily for a day of
                            hunting.

                            Following the Civil War, Beagles began arriving in America. They were immediately popular
                            with rabbit hunters and later became beloved family pets due to their friendly nature. Over
                            time, Beagles were used in both field hunting and show competitions.

                            Beagles have also been used in scientific research, particularly in studies of genetics and
                            pharmacology, due to their manageable size, gentle temperament, and strong sense of smell.
                            Despite this, their popularity as companion animals has grown steadily. Today, Beagles are
                            among the most recognizable and cherished dog breeds worldwide.

                            Their distinctive vocalizations, often described as “bay” or “howl,” made them excellent
                            hunting companions in packs, allowing hunters to track game even over long distances.
                            Additionally, their intelligence and curiosity make them active and playful family pets,
                            though sometimes challenging due to their stubborn streak.

                            In modern times, Beagles continue to be celebrated for their versatility, whether as hunting
                            dogs, family companions, or participants in canine sports and shows. Their charming
                            personality, adaptability, and enduring history ensure that the Beagle remains a favorite
                            breed around the world.

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <p>The American Kennel Club (AKC) registered its first Beagle, named Blunder, in 1885.According to the AKC,
                there are different ideas about how this breed and its name came about. Some say the name derives from
                the Gaelic word beag, meaning “little”, while others believe it relates to the French term for the sound
                hounds make while hunting: be’geule.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The Beagle breed has origins that can be traced back to Roman times, but the Beagle as we
                            know it
                            today was developed in the 19th century in England. Beagles were bred for the purpose of
                            hunting
                            small game, particularly rabbits, due to their excellent sense of smell. This breed's sense
                            of
                            smell is only surpassed by the Bloodhound. They were also prized for their compact size,
                            allowing a pack of Beagles to be transported easily for a day of hunting. Following the
                            Civil
                            War, Beagles began arriving in America. They were immediately popular with rabbit hunters.

                        <p>Beagles are known to suffer from a range of conditions. Eye disorders that can affect them
                            include cataracts, congenital stationary night blindness, cone-rod dystrophy 4, corneal
                            dystrophy, lens luxation, primary open-angle glaucoma, distichiasis, keratoconjunctivitis
                            sicca, optic nerve hypoplasia and micropapilla, persistent pupillary membranes, retinal
                            dysplasia, stationary night blindness, tapetal degeneration, and progressive retinal atrophy

                        <h2>Personality and Behavior</h2>
                        <p>Beagles are friendly, curious, and intelligent dogs, making them excellent companions for
                            families. They are known for their gentle temperament, playful nature, and strong sense of
                            smell. However, Beagles can also be stubborn and independent, which sometimes makes training
                            a bit challenging. Consistent, positive reinforcement is usually the most effective method
                            for teaching them commands and good behavior.

                        <p>The American Kennel Club (AKC) registered its first Beagle, named Blunder, in 1885. According
                            to the AKC, there are different ideas about how this breed and its name came about. Some say
                            the name derives from the Gaelic word beag, meaning “little”, while others believe it
                            relates to the French term for the sound hounds make while hunting: be’geule.
